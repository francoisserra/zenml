# Develop a Custom Annotator

Annotators are a stack component that enables the use of data annotation as part of your ZenML stack and pipelines. You
can use the associated CLI command to launch annotation, configure your datasets and get stats on how many labeled tasks
you have ready for use.

**Base abstraction in progress!**

We are actively working on the base abstraction for the annotators, which will be available soon. As a result, their
extension is not possible at the moment. If you would like to use an annotator in your stack, please check the list of
already available feature stores down below.
